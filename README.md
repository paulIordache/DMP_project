## ⚙️ System Design

1. **Power Generation**: The solar panel generates DC voltage.  
2. **Power Storage**: The rechargeable battery stores the energy.  
3. **Power Regulation**: The TP4056 module charges the battery, and the step-down converter regulates voltage to 5V for the Arduino.  
4. **Monitoring**:  
    - **Voltage Sensor**: Measures solar panel and battery voltage.  
    - **Current Sensor (INA219)**: Measures current output.  
5. **Data Display & Logging**:  
    - LCD displays real-time data.  
    - Optionally, log data to an SD card with timestamps via the RTC module.
